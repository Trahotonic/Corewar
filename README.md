# Corewar
#### A virtual "arena" in which programs fight against one another.  
  
This project can be broken down into three distinctive parts:  
  
• The assembler: a program that compiles champions and translates them from the language  
they are written in (assembly language) into “Bytecode”.  
Bytecode is a machine code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual machine.  
  
• The virtual machine: It’s the “arena” in which champions will be executed.  
It offers various functions, all of which are used for the battle of the champions.  
  
• The champion: a file written in assembler language  
containing data that defines program's behaviour on the "battlefield".

More detailed description of every part can be found in ./project_info/corewar.en.pdf.
